It was a really good way to demonstrate my understanding of Java as well as creating an algorithm that utilized binary addition. At the time of creating the program I was fascinated by binary and how numbers could be stored as 1s and 0s and how I could use that in my programs. The original version of this program displayed and had the prompts simply in the terminal of the IDE. However, to make it more useable and easier on the eyes I tried to keep most of it the same but make it utilize a GUI instead.

<h2><em>⚙️ How it works ⚙️</em></h2>
 This application uses JavaFX to build its GUI and provide a polished user experience. At its core, the program employs a 3D array of numbers, representing sets of potential birthday dates. The user interacts with the application by answering "Yes" or "No" to a series of questions about whether their birthday appears in the displayed set of dates.

 The logic behind the application relies on binary addition. If the user selects "Yes" for a particular set, the first number in that set is added to the calculated day. This process repeats for five sets, ultimately determining the user's birthday.

 The GUI includes hover effects for the buttons, where the "Yes" button turns green and the "No" button turns red when hovered over, adding a modern and interactive touch. Once all questions are answered, the program displays the guessed birthday in a clear and concise format. The elegant dark green background and intuitive layout ensure a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

 While simple in concept, this program showcases the versatility of JavaFX and how a basic idea can be transformed into an interactive and visually appealing application. It’s a fun way to combine programming logic with design to create something delightful for users!
